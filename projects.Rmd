#### Intership for Dr. Amber Gayle Thalmayer, University of ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland

For my BSc Internship, I traveled to Namibia for 6 weeks as part of the [SNF-funded project: Personality and Mental Health in Namibia](), Dr. Amber Gayle Thalmayer. I was responsible for data collection and management, collaborating with local researchers at the University of Namibia. For the last 4 weeks of the internship, I was there without my supervisor and oversaw the data collection, traveling to different parts of Namibia in order to distribute and collect finished surveys. I also contributed to publications with data analyses and manuscript reviewing.
